# SpectraOS v2.1 — The Interactive Desktop Experience

"Where nostalgia meets innovation — a living, breathing retro desktop that remembers why we fell in love with computers in the first place."

## Welcome to SpectraOS

Step into a digital time machine! Spectra Studios has transformed from a conventional portfolio into SpectraOS — a fully interactive retro desktop environment that blends the charm of 90s computing with modern web magic. This isn't just a website, it's an experience that transports you back to the golden era of computing while showcasing cutting-edge game development.

## What Makes SpectraOS Special

SpectraOS isn't just viewed, it's explored. Every click, drag, and interaction feels like you're using a genuine retro operating system, complete with boot sequences, draggable windows, and that satisfying CRT glow.

## What's New in v2.1

### Dynamic Theme System

Personalize your desktop experience with three distinct visual themes:

- **Midnight Blue** (Default): Classic Windows 98 aesthetic with deep blues and authentic gray tones
- **CRT Green**: Retro monochrome terminal experience with authentic green-on-black display and scanlines

**Theme Features:**
- Persistent theme selection saved in localStorage
- Real-time theme switching without page reload
- Complete interface overhaul including windows, buttons, and text

### The Pikachu Companion Feature

Meet your digital pet: A lively Pikachu GIF now runs across your desktop, chasing your cursor with playful determination.

- **Intelligent chasing mechanics:** Pikachu doesn't just follow — it anticipates, accelerates, and maintains a natural distance like a real companion.
- **Window-top visibility:** Watch Pikachu scamper over your application windows, adding depth and personality to the desktop environment.
- **Physics-based movement:** Realistic acceleration, momentum, and directional animations make Pikachu feel alive.

## Design Philosophy

> "We're not recreating the past — we're reinventing why we loved it."

SpectraOS represents a fundamental shift in digital portfolio design. Instead of following modern minimalist trends, we embraced retro maximalism, the joyful complexity of early computing interfaces where every pixel had personality and every interaction felt tangible.

This isn't just nostalgia, rather it's a statement about creativity, playfulness, and the emotional connection we form with technology. The careful recreation of CRT effects, the satisfying click of beveled buttons, our new Pikachu companion, and now the customizable theme system all serve to create an environment that feels both familiar and magical.
