## Version 2.0 — The SpectraOS Era

> "From modern minimalism to retro maximalism."
> Welcome to the new era of Spectra Studios, where creativity meets nostalgia.

### Overview

Spectra Studios has evolved from a conventional portfolio website into an interactive retro desktop experience inspired by the PC-98 and Windows 98 aesthetic.
The redesign transforms the site into a living interface, a nostalgic operating system called SpectraOS, where every window, folder, and animation evokes the charm of classic computing.

### What's New

- Desktop-style interface featuring draggable windows, folders, and taskbar.
- Boot-up sequence and CRT scanline overlay for authentic immersion.
- Retro palette: navy blues, muted greys, and off-white tones for that 90s OS look.
- MS Sans Serif-inspired typography system rebuilt using web-safe and pixel fonts.
- Organized windows for About, Projects, and Contact with each behaving like a native app.
- Download Resume button styled with 3D Win98 bevels.
- Improved responsiveness for a seamless retro experience across all devices.

### Design Philosophy

SpectraOS isn’t just a style — it’s a statement.
It embodies the nostalgia of early computing while expressing the creative innovation behind every Spectra Studios project.
Each pixel, border, and shadow is crafted to reflect the tactile, playful spirit of classic game UIs, a digital love letter to the past, reimagined for today.

### Tech Stack

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Custom window system (draggable, resizable elements)
- Font system: Share Tech Mono · VT323 · Pixel Operator
- Retro-inspired color variables and button borders

### Future Plans

- Add Easter Eggs and hidden retro system messages
- Expand the Projects window with embedded playable demos
- Integrate a command-line terminal mode for power users
- Include SpectraOS v2 themes (e.g., CRT Green, Vaporwave Pink, and Slate Grey)
